# mit_news_nlp
As part of the Bachelor's Degree in Data Science, this project involves an exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies applied to real-world data.
Webscrapped data from the https://news.mit.edu on the topic of artificial intelligence is cleaned by the code in data_preprocessing and then modeled in modeling. For preprocessing I'am using unicode normalization, tokenization, character clearing, number standarzation, lemmatization. For modeling part I cover coherence tests, LDA, NER, TF_IDF, wordclouds, sentiment analysis (using LLM and lexicon based).
